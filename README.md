# Telescope Control System (TCS)

This repository contains the Telescope Control System (TCS) for Manastash Ridge Observatory (MRO), developed by the Astronomy Undergraduate Engineering Group (AUEG) at the University of Washington. The TCS allows the user to control the 0.8m Ritchey-Chretien Telescope and its associated systems. A user manual for the graphical user interface, Bifrost, and developer information are available in the repository's wiki.
