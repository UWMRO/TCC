# Telescope Control System (TCS)

The Telescope Control System (TCS) for Manastash Ridge Observatory (MRO), developed by the Astronomy Undergraduate Engineering Group (AUEG) at the University of Washington, allows the user to control the 0.8m Ritchey-Chretien Telescope and its associated systems. A user manual for the graphical user interface, Bifrost, and a developer guide are available in the repository's wiki.
