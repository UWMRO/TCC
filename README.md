# Telescope Control Computer (TCC)

More information, including installation instructions, are available under the Wiki tab.

## Purpose
This repository contains code for use at Manastash Ridge Observatory (MRO). It provides a
Graphical User Interface (GUI), Bifrost, built in Python 2.7 for controlling the primary Ritchey-Chretien Telescope. This GUI is intended to allow control of the telescope as well as a new auto-guiding system being developed for MRO. The new TCC saw first use in Summer 2017.
